    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are a popular type of cybersecurity challenge. These events test participants' knowledge and skills in various areas of computer security. The goal is to capture "flags," which are secret pieces of data, by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, solving problems, or analyzing challenges.</p>

    <h2>Types of CTFs</h2>
    <p>There are typically two main types of CTFs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jeopardy-style:</strong> In this type, participants solve independent challenges across different categories (like cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, etc.). Each challenge rewards points, and the team with the highest points wins.</li>
        <li><strong>Attack-Defense:</strong> Teams defend their own vulnerable system while trying to attack the systems of other teams. The goal is to find and exploit weaknesses while securing your own network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Categories in CTFs</h2>
    <p>CTF competitions cover a wide range of cybersecurity domains. Some common categories include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Solving encryption and decryption problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Forensics:</strong> Analyzing digital artifacts to uncover hidden information.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Exploitation:</strong> Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Understanding and manipulating compiled code.</li>
        <li><strong>Pwn (Binary Exploitation):</strong> Finding vulnerabilities in binary files or memory to control a system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Participate in CTFs?</h2>
    <!-- d3RmQ1RGew== -->
    <p>There are several reasons to participate in CTFs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hone cybersecurity skills in real-world scenarios.</li>
        <li>Work as a team and collaborate on solving complex problems.</li>
        <li>Stay up to date with the latest security vulnerabilities and techniques.</li>
        <li>Build a reputation in the cybersecurity community.</li>
        <li>CTFs are often fun, challenging, and intellectually rewarding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Whether you're new to cybersecurity or an experienced professional, Capture the Flag competitions offer an exciting way to test your knowledge and improve your skills. They provide a hands-on learning experience, and participants often walk away with new insights into cybersecurity challenges.</p>
